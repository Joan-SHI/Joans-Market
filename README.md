# Joans Personal Project

Goal:
Use
 - Express
 - Knex
 - Database
 - SQLite3
 - React
 - API
 in my personal project so I have better understanding about them. This project will show Wellingtian landlords and tenants how the bank rates influences the market rent so they can make decisions more rationally and have a happy ending:)

To do:

Explore React;
Once I get my API approvals from MBIE and ASB, apply them in database.

Strectch Goal:
Read some articles about the factors which affect Market-rent. To see whehter I could introduce more types of API into database.
